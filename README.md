# Catch the Ball

Steps to run dev server -

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open a terminal in the root folder of the cloned repo.
3. Run command "npm run install-all" without the quotes.
4. Run command "edgedb project init" without the quotes.
5. Run command "npm run dev" without the quotes. This will run the client and server in the same terminal.

Note - There will be no data in the database initially. So you will have to signup.
